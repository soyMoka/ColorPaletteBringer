/* 
  Rules of Reducers

    - They should only calculate the new state value based on the state and action arguments
    - They are not allowed to modify the existing state. Instead, they must make immutable updates, by copying the existing state and making changes to the copied values.
    - They must not do any asynchronous logic or other "side effects"
